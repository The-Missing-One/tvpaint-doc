您需要访问 ((License depot)) 链接来激活您的许可证。您在购买软件后会收到TVPaint发送的确认邮件，此邮件中附有：发票和激活许可证的链接。

:::note

Please keep in mind that ((CodeMeter)) must be installed and running on the machine you are using the ((License depot)) from. It is included in the TVPaint installation package.

强烈建议使用以下Web浏览器之一：Firefox，Chrome或者Edge。

如果您收到此警告，请在注册软件之前安装 [Java 32 bits](https://www.java.com/zh-CN/download/manual.jsp)。

:::

Go to the activation page via the link to your ((License depot)). This link is contained in the email you've received following your purchase.

:::tip

In case you need to share your ((License depot)), link, please right click on the link contained in the email you've received following your purchase and select the « Copy link address » option. The ((License depot)) address shown in your web browser's address bar is shortened and can't be used to access it.

:::

You should then arrive on one of those two webpages:

***Licenses Overview webpage***

![Mon compte](/img/zh/download-install/license-depot-get.png)

***License Activation webpage***

The « Licenses Overview » webpage lists all of your licenses. In order to activate your license, click on the « Activate Licenses » orange button. The « License Activation » webpage pictured on the right should appear. Then, select the license you wish to activate. If a studio is lending you a license, please make sure to select only one license during this procedure. If you're managing licenses owned by a school, click on the checkbox located next to the "Name" field to select all licenses and activate them on your server.

If ((CodeMeter)) is correctly installed and this is the first time you activate a license on your computer, a ((CmContainer)) will be automatically created (as indicated by the « Get CmContainer automatically » sentence in the « Select CmContainer » field).

:::note

If your ((License depot)) web page displays something different from the above screenshots (for example, if the « Get CmContainer automatically » sentence doesn't appear), please proceed as follows:

- Make sure ((CodeMeter)) is installed and is running on your computer
- Restart your computer
- Open your web browser and clear its cache
- Go to your ((License depot)) again and see if the « Get CmContainer automatically » sentence finally appears. If it doesn't, try using a different web browser after having restarted your computer.

:::

:::tip

The ((CmContainer)) represents the computer on which the license will be activated.

:::

Click on the « Activate Selected licenses » button to activate your license. Don't refresh the webpage while the license is being activated.

完成上述流程后，您的许可证将被激活！ 赶快启动TVPaint Animation测试一下新功能吧！ :)

Once the license has been sent to the computer, you will have the possibility to send it back to the ((License depot))  if you ever wish to move the license to another computer. You can learn more about this procedure on our [« Rehost you license »](rehost) page.

:::note

如果您需要格式化计算机或将系统还原到出先前的某个设置，强烈建议您先从计算机上重新托管许可证。如果对文件系统进行了重要更改，该许可证可能会丢失。如果您的许可证因此而丢失，请与我们联系来恢复您的许可证。 请注意，许可证和 ((CmContainer)) 不能像普通文件那样复制，您的许可证将无法在复制的硬盘驱动器中使用。
