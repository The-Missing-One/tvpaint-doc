Sometimes, the activation or rehost of a license doesn’t successfully complete. In such cases, you may see that your license bears the status ‘Not completed’ when going to your ((License depot)).

This error is often caused by internet connection issues happening during the license’s activation or its rehost. It may also be caused by the ((License depot))’s webpage being refreshed while the license is being activated or deactivated.

Fortunately, solving this problem is quite easy. You just have to go back to your ((License depot)) using the computer you originally tried to activate or deactivate the license on. You should then see a ‘Continue License Transfer’ orange button:

Simply click on this button to complete the activation or rehosting process. You’ll then be invited to confirm this license transfer operation: click on the ‘Continue License Transfer Now’ button to do so. Your license should then be correctly activated or deactivated.
