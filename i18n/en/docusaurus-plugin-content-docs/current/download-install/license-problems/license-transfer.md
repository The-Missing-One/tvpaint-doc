title: 'File based license transfer issue'
---

You may stumble upon the following web page when trying to activate your license from your ((License depot)) :

![Mon compte](/img/en/download-install/license-problems/license-request-file.png)

This page invites you to activate your license via a file transfer, as you can see on the screenshot above.

:::note

However, this file transfer process should not be used to activate your TVPaint Animation license.

:::

Being prompted to activate your license via a file transfer means that ((CodeMeter)) hasn’t been installed or that it isn’t detected on the computer you’re currently using.

:::tip

((CodeMeter)) is an application designed to manage your license. Installing it is mandatory to activate or deactivate your license and for TVPaint Animation to run.

:::

Depending on your operating system the solution to this problem will be different:

- If you’re on Windows:

  ((CodeMeter)) is automatically installed with TVPaint Animation. Stumbling upon the above web page means that it isn’t detected yet. To solve this issue, please restart your computer. Once it’s done, open your web browser and clear its cache. You should now be able to go back to your ((License depot)) and activate your license as described in the [Register the software](../register) section of our documentation.


- If you’re on macOS:

 Make sure that ((CodeMeter)) has been installed on your computer. If this isn’t the case, please follow this page of our online documentation: [Install the software on macOS](../install/macos).  Once it’s done, activate your license by following the instructions in the [Register the software](../register) section.

If ((CodeMeter)) has been installed, please restart your Mac. Then, open your web browser and clear its cache. Go back to your ((License depot))  to activate your license as described in the [Register the software](../register) section of our documentation.
